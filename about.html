      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>We are a coalition of young people from R.I. fighting for fundamental change within our communities. Climate change poses an existential threat to our society, perpetrated by systems of racism, neoliberalism, xenophobia, ableism, homophobia/transphobia, and many many more. We see that a lot of the systems in place right now must change to not only stop climate change but to build a more just society for our children.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>We work with our communities to achieve intersectional climate justice and to ensure a safe, sustainable future.</p>

      <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="list-item-title">We fight for intersectional climate justice in Rhode Island.</p>

          <p>Intersectionality is the key to tackling the climate crisis. We cannot approach it unilaterally when it affects all of us differently. We come from all walks of life in the world, but we value our differences and similarities. Those in power have divided and suppressed our voices of justice for too long, thus we unite despite our differences for a better future.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="list-item-title">We unite and stand in solidarity with other movements fighting for justice in our community.</p>
          <p>To win the fight for a better climate, we understand we cannot stay alone in our movement for a sustainable world. We stand in solidarity for those in labor unions, movements against social injustice, and every level of organizing to demand for systemic change.
          We prioritize our local and community interactions focusing on getting to the hearts and minds of our neighbors, families, friends, religious leaders, classmates, and others to bring them into this movement. They are the way we can truly win our fight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="list-item-title">We believe everyone’s voice is important in the decision making process.</p>

          <p>When we come together as a team to make decisions, we make sure to hear each other’s voices and ideas so that we can move forward with the clearest goals in mind. We understand that we will always have disagreements time to time, but we value constructive criticism in a space we must grow and value one another. We encourage everyone to say their opinions and concerns without interruption and disrespect. This is an open space and we extend it to everyone who organizes with us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="list-item-title">We ask for help and give what we can.</p>
          <p>We all have something we can offer to this movement. Some of us can give us a couple of hours a week to organize where others can give us money. We invite everyone in open arms in any way they can contribute to our movement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="list-item-title">We are a movement of young people ready to take the fight to streets and meet with the opposition head on.</p>

          <p>We come together as a team to amplify the voices of our generation and fight for climate justice in our state of Rhode Island while holding those in power accountable.</p>
